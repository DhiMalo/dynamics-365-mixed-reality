You can use the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] to import 3D (CAD) models for use with the [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] [!include[pn-HoloLens](../includes/pn-HoloLens.md)] app or the [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] 
immersive headset app. You can also use the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] to move layouts created with the [!include[pn-HoloLens](../includes/pn-HoloLens.md)] app to use with immersive headsets, 
or vice versa. For information on using the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] with [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)], see the
