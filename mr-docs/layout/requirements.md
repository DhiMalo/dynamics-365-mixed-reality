# Device options and technical requirements for Dynamics 365 Layout

[!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] works with a Microsoft [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device or with a [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality immersive headset with motion controllers.

## HoloLens requirements

| **OS requirements**          | **Details**                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build 10.0.17134.77 or later | See [Update HoloLens](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12643/hololens-update-hololens) for instructions on upgrading to this build. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] clicker with [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)], but it has limited functionality. You can use the clicker to do menu selections and to scan a room, but you can't use it to manipulate objects.
