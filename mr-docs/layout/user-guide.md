## Get started with Dynamics 365 Layout: take advantage of learning tools

[!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] includes three tools that you can use to help you learn how to do common tasks such as measuring, copying, grouping, resizing, and accessing settings.

### Animated out-of-the-box experience for HoloLens 2 users

If you use [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2, after you install the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app, and before you sign in, you'll see an animated 3D experience that shows the benefits and key capabilities of [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)].

### Teaching moments

Teaching moments provide a series of images that make it easy to understand common tasks. To access teaching moments, air tap **Help**, and then air tap the area you need help with.

![Teaching moments.](media/teaching-moments.PNG "Teaching moments")

### Demo layouts

Demo layouts use prebuilt layouts to demonstrate how to build different parts of a manufacturing plant. There are three demos to choose from:
- Move and resize
- Grouping and measurement
- Copy and paste

For example, in the Copy and paste demo, learn how to complete a conveyor belt by copying and positioning sections.

To access demo layouts, pick the demo you want from the **Layouts** menu.

![Demo layouts.](media/demo-layouts.PNG "Demo layouts")

## Use Dynamics 365 Layout

To use [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)], you create space layouts on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or PC and then use a
[!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality immersive headset to place 3D models in the
layouts. The [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] app comes with a set of preinstalled models, and you can
also add your own.

### Create a layout

There are two ways to create a layout:

-   Use [Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/visio/) to design a
    floor plan, and then export it to [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] or [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Mixed Reality.

-   Use [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to scan a space.

#### Create a layout with Microsoft Visio

**Step 1: Download and install the [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)] Add-in for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)]**

1.  Open the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)].

2.  Select **About**, and then select the 32-bit or the 64-bit download (choose
    the one that matches your version of [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)]).
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Download Visio add-in.](media/visio-download.PNG "Download Visio add-in") 

3.  Open [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)], and then select **File** \> **Options** \> **Add-ins**.

4.  Next to **Manage**, select **COM Add-ins**, and then select **Go**.

5.  Select **[!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)] Add-in for [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)]**, and then select **Add**.

**Step 2: Create your floor plan with [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-visio](../includes/pn-visio.md)]**

-   When the floor plan is ready, select the **[!include[pn-layout](../includes/pn-layout.md)]** tab, select **Export**,
    and then save your floor plan.

**Step 3: Import your floor plan using the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)]**

1.  In the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)], select **This PC** \> **Add layout**, and then navigate
    to the floor plan.

2.  Select the floor plan, and then select **Open**.

    The floor plan shows up automatically in [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] on a mixed reality immersive
headset connected to the same PC.

To use the layout on [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], you’ll need to move it there:

1.  Connect your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to your PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)] on the PC, and then select **This PC** \> **Layouts**.

3.  Select the check box on the layouts you want to copy, and then select
    **Send**.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Move layout to HoloLens.](media/selected-layouts-hololens.PNG "Move layout to HoloLens")

4.  On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], open the [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] app. You’ll find your layout on the **Layouts**
    tab.

#### Create a layout with HoloLens

1.  On your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device, open the [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] app.

2.  Select **New layout**, and then follow the instructions for scanning your
    space and creating a layout.

To move the layout to your PC so you can open it on a mixed reality immersive
headset: 

1.  Connect the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] to the PC using the USB cable.

2.  Open the [!include[pn-dyn-365-import-tool](../includes/pn-dyn-365-import-tool.md)], and then select the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] name.

3.  Select the check box on the layout you want to send to your PC, and then
    select **Send**.

## Lock a layout

You can lock a layout to prevent unintentional changes. This is particularly useful when you want to share a layout with your peers for reviewing purposes. 

To lock a layout, air tap **Lock layout** in the sidebar menu. This locks the current layout for editing.

![Lock layout.](media/locked-layout.PNG "Lock layout")

A lock graphic is displayed in the top right corner of the layout tile.
 
![Locked layout graphic.](media/locked-layout-graphic.PNG "Locked layout graphic")
 
After a layout has been locked, if someone selects a model in the layout, on the third consecutive attempt, a pop-up will appear to let them know that the layout is locked for editing. A similar pop-up is displayed when attempting to place a model from the **Layout** menu into the current layout.

To unlock a layout, air tap **Unlock layout** in the sidebar menu. 
 
![Unlock layout.](media/unlock-layout.PNG "Unlock layout")

## Improve performance when your models don't require texture or multiple colors

In certain scenarios, textures or multiple colors might not be important for visualizing 3D models. In these cases, to improve 
performance, you might want to turn off textures and use a single color. You can do this by using the **Performance** setting. 

To turn the **Performance** setting on or off:

- Select **Settings**, select **Performance**, and then select **Simplify objects by using just one color**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Performance mode setting.](media/performance-mode-setting.PNG "Performance mode setting")

## Turn off fading of holograms

By default, holograms fade when you get within 45 centimeters of them. You can use the **Hologram Fade** setting if you want to turn off this fade effect and get up close to your holograms.

![Hologram Fade setting.](media/hologram-fade.PNG "Hologram Fade setting")

Switch hologram fading back on at any time by switching the setting back to **On**.
