# Deploy Dynamics 365 Layout

With [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] you can bridge the gap between the real and digital worlds to complete crucial tasks faster, safer, and more efficiently, and create new ways to connect with customers and partners.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>[!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] is being discontinued as a separate application. For more information, see [Announcing the transition of Dynamics 365 Layout](https://aka.ms/LayoutTransition).

## Assign licenses to users

If you already have a subscription to [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] and want to assign additional users, each user you assign a license to will need an [!include[pn-azure-active-directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] ([!include[pn-azure](../includes/pn-azure.md)] AD) account.

### Assign a license to a user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center

1. In the [!include[pn-microsoft-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-microsoft-365-admin-center.md)], under **Billing** in the left navigation, select **Subscriptions**, and then select **Assign to users**.

   ![Select Subscriptions.](../media/AssignUsers.PNG "Select Subscriptions")
   
2. Select the users you'd like to assign the trial or subscription to, and then in the **Bulk actions** menu on the right side of the screen, select **Edit product licenses**. 

   ![Edit product licenses.](../media/EditLicenses.PNG "Edit product licenses")
   
3. In the **Assign products** screen, select the **Add to existing product license assignments** option, and then select **Next**.

4. Select the licenses you want to enable for the selected users, and then select **Add**.

## Make the Dynamics 365 Layout app available to your users

After you’ve assigned licenses to your users through the [!include[pn-microsoft-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-microsoft-365-admin-center.md)] or Partner Center, you can make [!include[pn-dyn-365-layout](../includes/pn-dyn-365-layout.md)] available through one of the following:

-   [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store for Consumers

-   [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store for Business

If you use [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store for Business, you can have users install the app
in any of the following ways:

-   From your organization’s private store

-   From an email link that you send

-   Through mobile device management (MDM)

### Install Dynamics 365 Layout from Microsoft Store for Consumers
