# Restrict the ability to access asset records in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

If you [have a scenario where you need to protect your company information](restricted-mode-overview.md), you can restrict the ability for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users on HoloLens from [accessing asset records](asset-capture-overview.md). If you don't restrict the ability to access asset records, by default, HoloLens users will be able to access them. 

When you restrict the ability to access asset records this way, if a user selects the **Assets** tab in the Remote Assist model-driven app, they'll see the following message.

 ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-model-driven-app.jpg "XXX")

On HoloLens, users will see a message that lets them know they don't have the appropriate permissions. 

## Restrict the ability to access asset records

To restrict the ability to access asset records, first make a copy of the default role, and then remove the ability to access assets from the default role. The copy of the default role retains the permissions for accessing asset records. You can use this copied role if some users **DO** need to be able to access asset records. Since the default role will not have permissions for accessing asset records, you'll need to assign the copied role to any user that **DOES** need to access asset records. You'll need to do this for each each environment that the user has access to. 

### Make a copy of the default role

1. Sign into the environment that has the asset records that you want to protect, select the **Settings** button, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

2. In the Dynamics 365 window, select the down arrow next to **Settings**, and then select **Security**.

3. Select **Security Roles**.

4. Find and select the **Remote Assist - App User** role (the default role), select the down arrow next to **More Actions**, and then select **Copy Role**.

5. Add a descriptive name for the new role (for example, Remote Assist - App User (with Assets)), and then select **OK**.

### Edit the default role and assign it

Next, you'll remove permissions to access asset records from the default role. 

1. Select the **Remote Assist - App User** default role. 

     ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-select-default-role.jpg "XXX")

2. Select the **Custom Entities** tab, and then disable access for all scopes (Read, Write, and so on) for the following entities:

    - Customer Asset
    - Customer Asset Attachment
    - Customer Asset Category

     ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-custom-entities.jpg "XXX")

3. Go back to **Settings > Security**, and then select **Users**.

     ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-users.jpg "XXX")

4. Find and select the desired user, and then select **Manage Roles**.

     ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-manage-roles.jpg "XXX")

5. In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, make sure that the **Remote Assist - App User** role is selected.

     ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-selected-role.jpg "XXX")

6. In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, make sure that the following roles are not selected:

    - Remote Assist - App User (with Assets)
    - Remote Assist - Administrator
    - Field Service - Administrator
    - Field Service - Dispatcher
    - Field Service - Resource

     ![XXX.](media/restricted-mode-assets-cleared-roles.jpg "XXX")

7. Verify that the user can access the desired resources and canâ€™t access assets before handing the account to the end user.
