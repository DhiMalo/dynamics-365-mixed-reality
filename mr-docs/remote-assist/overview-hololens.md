# Overview of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens and HoloLens 2

When you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens or HoloLens 2, you can collaborate with one or more Microsoft Teams desktop users or one Teams mobile user. Remote Assist on HoloLens and HoloLens 2 offer the same capabilities; however, there are slight differences in the way you interact with holograms. Those differences are described in this article.

## Prerequisites

To use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist with HoloLens or HoloLens 2, you need:

- A subscription to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Microsoft Teams. The Teams license is included with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist. 
- A HoloLens or HoloLens 2 running the [Windows 10 April 2018 update](requirements.md) or later.
- A remote collaborator using the Teams desktop application or the Teams mobile app.  
- An internet connection. At least [1.5 mpbs of bandwidth is recommended](/microsoftteams/upgrade-prepare-environment-prepare-network#bandwidth-planning).
- To know your credentials for signing into the HoloLens and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.
- To have Dynamics 365 Remote Assist installed on your HoloLens or HoloLens 2.
- (Optional) To connect to Dynamics 365 Field Service from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, you'll need a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist Attach license. [Learn more](buy-remote-assist.md)

## Overview of core features

When you launch Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, the **Call** tab is selected by default. This is where you'll see your recent contacts. You can use the tools in the top-right corner to access Dynamics 365 Field Service bookings, move the window, or pin the window to a particular place in your world.

When you join a call or meeting, you'll see a video card. When you're in a call, the tools appear at the top and bottom of the video card. The participant tray displays the avatars for all call participants.

Anyone on the call can also send files, which will pop up in the space of the people they're collaborating with.  

## Supported types of calls

As a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user, you can make or join a one-to-one call, group call, or scheduled meeting by using Teams or Outlook.

Remote collaborators can join the call using the Microsoft Teams desktop application or the mobile app.  

In a call, remote collaborators can see everything you see (including holograms and the real world behind the holograms) and can add annotations, insert files into your world, and more.

## Collaborating with a Teams desktop user versus a Teams mobile user

A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user can join a one-to-one call, group call, or meeting with a Teams desktop user.

A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user can join a one-to-one call with a Teams mobile user.

## Using HoloLens gestures in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

> [!Note]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens and HoloLens 2 offer the same capabilities. However, HoloLens gestures differ from HoloLens 2 gestures. Learn how to [navigate HoloLens gestures](/hololens/hololens1-basic-usage) or [navigate Hololens 2 gestures](/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage) before reading the rest of this article. You may also want to watch how-to videos showing how to use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist features on HoloLens.

HoloLens offers several ways to interact with holograms. See [the HoloLens basics guide](/hololens/hololens1-basic-usage) to learn how to:

- Open the **Start** menu using the Bloom gesture
- Select holograms with gaze, air tap, and voice
- Move, resize, and rotate apps

## Using HoloLens 2 gestures in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

HoloLens 2 offers more ways for you to navigate the device and various applications. See [this HoloLens 2 basics guide](/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage) to learn how to:

- Open the **Start** menu by tapping your wrist
- Select holograms with gaze, air tap, voice, and touch
- Move, resize, and rotate apps

With HoloLens 2, you can select things in a few different ways:

- If the object is out of your reach, extend your arm, aim your hand ray, and then air tap.
- If the object is within your reach, touch it directly.
- To use your voice, say "Remote Assist" followed by the voice command for that button. [See a full list of voice commands](voice-commands-hololens.md). The easiest way to see the voice command for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist features is to say "Remote Assist." Then, the app will display the name of each button. After a few seconds, these labels will automatically disappear.


A good way to learn Dynamics 365 Remote Assist features and voice commands is to say "Remote Assist." When you're in a call, the app shows what it believes you said by showing a check mark and "Remote Assist." Then the app shows the name of each button. After a few seconds, these labels automatically disappear.

To see the button labels again after they disappear:

- If you're using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens, hover your gaze cursor over each button.

- If you're using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens 2 and the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist UI is within your reach, hover your finger over the buttons. If the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist UI is out of reach, extend your arm and hover the hand ray over the buttons.

## Benefits of integrating with Dynamics 365 Field Service

If your organization uses Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage work orders, the technician using HoloLens can view Dynamics 365 Field Service bookings from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and do heads-up, hands-free calling in the context of a Field Service booking. For example, the technician can:

- View booking details
- Quickly call the assigned collaborator  
- Save snapshots to a booking
- Save call artifacts to the work order that the booking is associated with, including the call log and files shared during the call

## Supported languages

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist supports different languages on HoloLens versus HoloLens 2. Check if your language is supported in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist in [our FAQs](faq-hololens.md).
