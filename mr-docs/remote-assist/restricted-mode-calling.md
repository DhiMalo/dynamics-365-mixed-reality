# Restrict calling in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

If you [have a scenario where you need to protect company information](restricted-mode-overview.md) from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens users, you can restrict the ability to:

- Initiate calls 
- Receive incoming calls
- Access contacts

You can do this without affecting their ability to join meetings or receive meeting notifications (in advance or while a meeting is already underway), so they can continue to user Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to troubleshoot issues with colleagues. 

> [!NOTE]
> You must have Microsoft Teams admin privileges to restrict calling in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

## Restrict calling

You can restrict calling by creating a new Microsoft Teams policy, and then assign that policy to the appropriate users. 

1. Go to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) and sign in with your admin credentials. 

2. In the left pane, select **Calling policies**, and then select **Add**.

3. Enter a name for your policy, turn **Make private calls** to **Off**, and then select **Save**. 

4. In the left pane, select **Manage users**, and then select the user you want to assign the policy to. IS IT THE USER OR A POLICY YOU'RE SELECTING HERE?
5. Select the **Policies** button, and then select **Edit**.
6. 


    > [!TIP]
    > You can also assign policies to groups.
