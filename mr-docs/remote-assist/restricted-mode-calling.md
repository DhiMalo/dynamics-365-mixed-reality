# Restrict calling in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

If you [have a scenario where you need to protect company information](restricted-mode-overview.md) from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens users, you can restrict the ability to:

- Initiate calls 
- Receive incoming calls
- Access contacts

You can do this without affecting their ability to join meetings or receive meeting notifications, so they can continue to user Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to troubleshoot issues with colleagues. 

> [!NOTE]
> You must have Microsoft Teams admin privileges to restrict calling.

## Restrict calling

You restrict calling through a Microsoft Teams policy. First, you create a new policy, and then you assign the policy to users. NOTE ABOUT ASSIGNING POLICIES TO GROUPS.

1. Go to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.md) and sign in with your admin credentials. NEED LINK TO MICROSOFT TEAMS ADMIN CENTER.
