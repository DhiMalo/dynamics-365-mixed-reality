# Restrict calling in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

If you [have a scenario where you need to protect company information](restricted-mode-overview.md) from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens users, you can restrict the ability to:

- Initiate calls 
- Receive incoming calls
- Access contacts

You can do this without affecting their ability to join meetings or receive meeting notifications so they can continue to troubleshoot issues with colleagues by using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens. You can restrict calling through a Microsoft Teams policy.
