access assets. For example, you might provide HoloLens devices installed with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to other businesses as part of your customer support. You don't want these users to initiate calls or access company files or assets, but you do want them to be able to join meetings and receive meeting notifications so they can troubleshoot issues.
