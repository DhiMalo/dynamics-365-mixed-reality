# Restrict the ability for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users on HoloLens from signing out

If you [have a scenario where you need to protect your company information](restricted-mode-overview.md), you can restrict the ability for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users on HoloLens from signing out. You can do this by [setting up HoloLens in Kiosk mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens-kiosk?tabs=uisak%2Cautologon). When you set up HoloLens in Kiosk mode, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist automatically prevents users from signing out of the app. You can also use Kiosk mode to show just selected apps in the **Start** menu. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HoloLens users must be on OS version 22H1 (Spring 2022 release) or later to use Kiosk mode. You can't restrict users of the mobile app from signing out of the app.
