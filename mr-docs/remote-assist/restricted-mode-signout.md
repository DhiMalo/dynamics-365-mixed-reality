If you [have a scenario where you need to protect your company information](restricted-mode-overview.md), you can restrict the ability for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users on HoloLens from changing user accounts. You can do this by [setting up HoloLens in kiosk mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-kiosk?tabs=uisak%2Cnonaadlogon)

When you set up HoloLens in kiosk mode, users cannot sign out of the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app.
