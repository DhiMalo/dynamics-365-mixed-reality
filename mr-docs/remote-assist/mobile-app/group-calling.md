# Group calls in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

Many problems are easier to solve if you can bring together specialists from around the world with different knowledge sets. Having multiple perspectives is crucial in providing technicians with the ability to accurately resolve problems. With the ability for three or more participants to join Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile calls, technicians can collaborate with more than one specialist for guidance, validation, or knowledge-sharing purposes.

A group call in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile begins as a one-to-one call. Any call participant can then add an additional participant to the call. During a group call, there can be any combination of three or more participants using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens, or Microsoft Teams desktop. For example, there can be two users on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and one user on Teams desktop, or two users on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and two users on Teams desktop.

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile does not support group calls with Teams mobile at this time. The Teams mobile user can join the group call, but can't add mixed-reality annotations in the shared environment.

1. In a one-to-one call with a remote collaborator, a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile user can add more participants to the call by selecting ![Screenshot showing more environment actions.](media/ellipsis.png "More environment actions") > **Participants**.

A group call is a one-to-one call that call participants can add more participants to. A meeting is scheduled via Microsoft Teams or Outlook. At this time, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile does not support meetings.

### Can Teams mobile users join a group call with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users?
Yes, but Teams mobile users can't add mixed-reality annotations in the shared environment. 

### Can a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens user annotate in another call participant's environment?
No. They can only add mixed-reality annotations in their own environment and receive mixed-reality annotations from other users.

### How many participants can join a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile group call? 

[Learn about the number of participants that can join a Microsoft Teams call](/MicrosoftTeams/limits-specifications-teams#meetings-and-calls).
