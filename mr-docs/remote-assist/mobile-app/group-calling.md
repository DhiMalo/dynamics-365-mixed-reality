# Group calls with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

Many problems often require more than one specialist from around the world with different knowledge domains.

With the ability to join Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile calls with three or more participants, technicians can collaborate with more than one specialist for guidance, validation, or knowledge sharing purposes.

A group call on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile begins as a one-to-one call, and any call participant can add someone to the call. During a group call, there can be any combination at least three or more participants using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile, Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens, or Microsoft Teams desktop. For instance, there can be two users on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and one user on Teams desktop, or two users on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile and two users on Teams desktop.
