# Annotate the technician's shared environment

In Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile, mixed-reality annotations give technicians and remote collaborators the power to visually specify an area or a particular asset in their environment to look at or manipulate. During a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile video call, the technician shares their environment with the remote collaborator through their rear-facing camera. The technician can instantly place mixed-reality annotations in the shared environment. The remote collaborator  places mixed-reality annotations on a snapshot of the technician's shared environment. 

## Learn the annotation tools

### Mobile app

If you're using the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile app, you'll see the following annotation toolbar.

If you select the down arrow next to the left-most button (the active tool), the button drops down.
