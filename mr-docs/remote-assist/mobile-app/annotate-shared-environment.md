# Annotate the technician's shared environment

In Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile, mixed reality annotations give technicians and remote collaborators the power to visually specify an area or particular asset in their environment to look at or manipulate. During a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile video call, the technicians will share their environment with the remote collaborator through their rear-facing camera. The technician can instantly place mixed reality annotations on their shared environment. However, the remote collaborator must place mixed reality annotations on a snapshot of the technician's shared environment. After the remote collaborator adds mixed reality annotations to the technician's shared environment, the annotations will appear in the shared environment. 

## Learn the annotation tools

### Annotation toolbar

### Add arrow annotation 

To position the arrow: 

1. Make sure the arrow is selected in the annotation toolbar. 

2. Move your device around to position the dot on the object or area you want to highlight.

3. Tap to place the ghost arrow on your device screen.

4. To rotate the arrow, tap and drag the arrow in a circular motion (360 degrees).

### Add ink annotation 

To determine where to start drawing:

1. Make sure the ink pen is selected in the annotation toolbar.
 
2. Tap and drag on the screen to start drawing. 

## Annotating for technicians using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

The annotation toolbar allows technicians to place arrows and drawings in their environment. The color picker changes the color of annotations. The **Undo** button allows technicians to remove the last annotation that they placed in their environment. The **Delete All** button allows technicians to remove all annotations that they placed in their environment (they cannot remove the expert's annotations).

1. As the technician, you can place your annotations in your shared environment. The remote collaborator will see your annotations in real time on their device.

## Adding annotations for remote collaborators in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile calls

1. To add annotations, select **Start annotating**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To delete all annotations you add during an editing session, select **Delete All**.

2. You'll see a snapshot of the technician's environment. You can add your annotations to that snapshot.

3. To stop adding annotations to the snapshot, select the **Check mark** button. You'll return to the technician's live video feed and your annotations will automatically appear in the technician's environment.

## Adding annotations for remote collaborators in Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile to Teams desktop or mobile calls

1. The annotation toolbar allows remote collaborators to place Arrows and Drawings into their environment. The Color Picker changes the color of your annotations. The Undo icon allows remote collaborators to remove the last annotation that they placed in their environment. The **Delete All** button allows remote collaborators to remove all annotations that they placed in their environment (they cannot remove the technicianâ€™s annotations).
