# Use the in-app tutorial on Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

Technicians can use the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile in-app, guided tutorial to jump-start their ability to use the app's augmented reality (AR) capabilities. With AR, technicians can share their real-world environments and connect with remote collaborators to walk through repair or inspection processes. Both call participants can reference objects and provide instructions by placing mixed-reality annotations into the technician's shared environment.

Use the guided tutorial to:

- Learn how to move your device around so that the app can detect your surroundings and surfaces for a better mixed-reality annotation placement experience.

- Place and manipulate mixed-reality annotations, such as arrows and drawings.

## Prerequisites

- To follow along with this guide, you should have a mobile device with ARCore or ARKit support. [Learn more about device requirements](../requirements.md)

> [!Note]
> No AR capabilities? No problem! Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile is also available on unsupported AR mobile devices. [Learn more about using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile on devices without AR](./calls-using-devices-without-AR.md)

## How it works

1. To launch the tutorial, on the **Sign in** screen, select **Try it**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you're already signed in and want to start the tutorial, go to **Menu** > **Learn the tools**.

2. When you start the tutorial, you're prompted to move your phone side-to-side for better surface detection.

3. Select the **Arrow** tool.

8. Practice placing and using other annotations. Try the **Color picker**, **Undo**, or **Delete all** annotation buttons.

## Techniques to improve surface detection

- Move your phone from side-to-side at the beginning of a video call.
- Try moving your phone more slowly.
- Place annotations in your device's field of view and avoid lots of sudden movements.
- Avoid frequently minimizing the app and reopening it while there are annotations present.

## Limitations that may hinder accurate surface detection

- Flat surfaces without texture, such as a white desk.
- Environments with dim lighting or very bright lighting.
- Transparent or reflective surfaces like glass.
- Dynamic or moving surfaces.

## How to resolve error messages

Throughout the tutorial or during the call, technicians may be prompted that they have "**lost tracking**" because Dynamics 365 Remote Assist has not adequately detected their surroundings or surfaces. In this case, technicians will be unable to place any mixed reality annotations until their surfaces are detected. Let's look at a few ways technicians can better track their environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Remote collaborators won't be able to place mixed reality annotations when the technician has lost tracking.

1. Move your device from **side-to-side** to better detect your surroundings or surfaces.

2. Move your device **further away**.

3. Move your device **closer**.

4. Try **turning on some lights** to brighten dimly lit spaces.
