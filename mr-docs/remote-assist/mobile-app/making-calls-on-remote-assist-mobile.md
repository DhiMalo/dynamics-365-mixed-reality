## Definitions 

A **one-to-one call** includes two participants. For example, if you're repairing a machine and need help on-the-go, you can make a one-to-one call to a remote collaborator using Teams desktop or Teams mobile.

A **group call** is an ad-hoc call that includes three or more participants. For example, if you're inspecting an asset in a one-to-one call but need a third person's expertise, any participant on the call can add a third person to create a group call.
