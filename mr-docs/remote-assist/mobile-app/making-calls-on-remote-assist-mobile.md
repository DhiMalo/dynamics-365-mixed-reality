Technicians can join one-to-one video calls and group video calls with three or more participants.

## Definitions 
A **one-to-one call** includes two participants. For example, if you're repairing a machine and need help on-the-go, you can make a one-to-one call to a remote collaborator who uses Teams.

A **group call** is an adhoc call that includes three or more participants. For example, if you're inspecting an asset in a one-to-one call but need a third person's expertise, any participant can add the third person to the call to form a group call.
