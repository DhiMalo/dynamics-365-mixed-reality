# Use Dynamics 365 Field Service with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

By pairing the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile application with Dynamics 365 Field Service, organizations can seamlessly capture relevant contextual information from their technicians in the field. Field service technicians can:

- Use Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile to launch the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile app and make calls to remote collaborators on both iOS and Android devices.

- Seamlessly post call history to their Dynamics 365 Field Service work order at the end of a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile call, including:

   - Call logs, including time, date, call duration, and the remote collaborator's name
   - File URLs
   - In-call snapshot URLs

## Prerequisites

- In order to follow along with this guide, you should have completed the setup instructions for Field Service and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist integration. Learn how to set up the Dynamics 365 Field Service with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile [here](../troubleshoot-field-service.md).

## How it works

Now that we have it enabled, let's see how integration with Field Service works for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile.

1. At the end of a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile call, you are prompted to post your call log, if no files, images, or snapshots are shared, to your Field Service work order. Select **Post**.

2. If files, images, and/or snapshots are shared in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist text chat, you'll see a list with your call log and files, images, and snapshots that you can post to your Field Service work order. Select **Post All**.

    > [!Tip]
    > If you want to post the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call recording to your Field Service work order, you can copy and paste the Microsoft Stream URL that will be in your Microsoft Teams chat into your work order. Remember to adjust the Microsoft Stream permissions to allow access to others.

3. If you have **active bookings** assigned to you through Field Service, you'll see them listed. Select your booking and select **Post**.

4. If you have no bookings assigned to your account, you can **Refresh** your screen or **Discard** your post.

5. If you still don't see the booking you're looking for, it might be because you have access to multiple instances (organizations). You can select the **Ellipses** icon to return to your instance, and then select another **Instance**. Then continue from **Step 3**.

6. You will return to your contact list and you will be notified when your call log and files have successfully been posted to your Field Service work order and then you can sign in to your work order.

7. You can go to the Field Service work order and view the call log and files that have been posted from Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile. Then you can copy and paste the files URL in a new tab to view the files.

    > [!Note]
    > If someone viewing your Field Service work order, such as an admin or dispatcher, wants to view the files, they must request access to your files on OneDrive.
