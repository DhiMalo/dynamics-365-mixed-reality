# Calls between Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile users

Technicians using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile can call and collaborate with their peers who are also using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile.

## Prerequisites

- Call receivers must **not** have the Microsoft Teams application on their mobile devices. 

- Technicians must have a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist [free trial](../try-remote-assist.md) or [subscription](../buy-remote-assist.md).

- Remote collaborators must have a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist free trial or subscription and a Microsoft Teams [free trial or subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software).

7. Either call participant can place annotations directly in the shared environment (their own environment) or by selecting **Start Annotating**. 

    > [!NOTE]
