# Use HTML in instruction card text

If you want to use colors or rich-text formatting (for example, bold, italic, or underline) in your Dynamics 365 Guides instruction card text, you can add HTML markup directly to an
instruction card in the PC app. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is an unsupported feature and is subject to change.

The colors available in Dynamics 365 Guides are: 

- Black
- Blue
- Green
- Orange
- Purple
- Red
- White
- Yellow

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using yellow, make sure to lowercase the word "yellow" in your HTML text. Otherwise, the color won't be applied. For Cyan, use the hex code #00FFFF.
