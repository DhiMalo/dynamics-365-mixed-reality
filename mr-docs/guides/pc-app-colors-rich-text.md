# Use HTML in instruction card text in Dynamics 365 Guides

If you want to use colors or rich-text formatting (for example, bold, italic, or underline) in your Dynamics 365 Guides instruction card text, you can add HTML markup directly to an instruction card in the PC app. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is an unsupported feature and is subject to change.

The colors available in Dynamics 365 Guides are: 

- Black
- Blue
- Green
- Orange
- Purple
- Red
- White
- Yellow
- Cyan

> [!NOTE]
> Mke sure to use lowercase for colors ("yellow", for example) in HTML markdown. Otherwise, the colors won't be applied. For Cyan, use the hex code #00FFFF.
