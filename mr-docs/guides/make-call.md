# Make a call in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

If you're using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0, you can make a call while you're working with a guide in the HoloLens app. For example, if you're authoring a guide, you might want to call an expert to get advice on a specific procedure. If you're operating a guide, you might want to call an expert to get help on a procedure or to do a remote inspection. In either case, the remote expert answers the call using Microsoft Teams desktop and can see everything that you see on your HoloLens and can provide input as needed. 

You can start a call after you open a guide, open a guide after placing a call, or do both simultaneously. You can also make a call or work on a guide independently.

## Limitations

- Only outgoing phone calls from the HoloLens user are supported at this time. The expert on Teams desktop can't call the HoloLens user.

- Only one-to-one calling is supported at this time. The Teams desktop user can add additional participants to the call, but only the video stream of the original Teams desktop user is shared with the HoloLens user.

## Make a call

1. Look at the palm of your hand to open the Main menu, and then select the **Call activity** button.

2. In the **Recent people** screen, select a contact. If you don't see the contact you're looking for, select the **Search** button at the bottom of the screen.

    While you're on the call, you can use the call controls below the **Active call** window to turn your video feed off or on, to mute or unmute yourself, or to end the call. By default, your video stream is on and your HoloLens is not muted.

## Reopen the Call activity window

The **Call activity** window doesn't follow you around in your environment like the instruction card, but you can easily bring it up at any time by looking at your palm to open the Main menu. [Learn more about the Main menu in Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0](main-menu.md).
