# Make a call in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

If you're using Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0, you can make a call while you're working with a guide in the HoloLens app. For example, if you're authoring a guide, you might want to call an expert to get advice on a specific procedure. If you're operating a guide, you might want to call an expert to get help on a procedure or to do a remote inspection. In either case the remote expert can see everything that you see on your HoloLens and provide input as needed. 

You can start a call after you open a guide, open a guide after placing a call, or do both simiultaneously. You can also make a call or work on a guide independently. 

## Make a call
