If you're working with small objects in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, and there's minimal distance between the objects, you might experience problems when trying to point at those objects due to HoloLens accuracy thresholds. For example, the following graphic shows a machine that has buttons that are very close together.

If you add 3D objects to point at the buttons in this case, it may be hard for the operator to interpret the holographic clutter, as shown in the following graphic.
