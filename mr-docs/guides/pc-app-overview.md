# Overview of authoring a guide with the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app

You use the PC authoring app in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] as the first step in the authoring process.

Use the PC app to complete these tasks:

- [Create a guide](create-guide.md).

- [Select an anchoring method](pc-app-anchor.md).

- [Add tasks and steps](pc-app-orientation.md).

- Write the instructions for your steps.

- Assign different types of content to support the steps. Here are some examples of supporting content:

    - [3D parts](pc-app-3D-parts.md)

    - [3D objects](pc-app-3D-toolkit.md), such as objects from the 3D toolkit (for example, arrows and numbers)

    - [2D media (images and videos)](pc-app-images.md)
