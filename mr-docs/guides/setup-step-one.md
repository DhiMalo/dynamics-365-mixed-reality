# Dynamics 365 Guides setup, step 1: Buy a subscription or sign up for a free trial

> [!NOTE]
> Before you complete this step of the setup process, be sure to see [Overview of setting up Dynamics 365 Guides](setup.md).

## Two ways to get a Dynamics 365 Guides subscription

There are two ways to get a [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription:

- If you have a Microsoft work account, you can go directly to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home) and search for a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription there.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you can't access the Microsoft 365 admin center link, contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.

- [Sign up for a free 60-day trial](trial-signup.md). 

## Assign the Dynamics 365 Guides license to user accounts

After you sign up for a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] subscription, you must assign the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] license to user accounts.

1. Open the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home).

3. Select **Manage product licenses**.
