# Duplicate a 3D model in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app to use it for similar items

Sometimes when you're working with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app, you might need multiple copies of the same 3D models to point to similar items in the 
work area. Instead of adding new instances of a 3D model from the asset bin and setting the position and style each time, you can save time by duplicating the 3D model. 
The duplicates will have the same rotation and style settings as the original.

## Duplicate a 3D model

1. Air tap a hologram that you've already placed in the real world to select it.

2. Air tap the **Edit Hologram** (pencil) button.

3. Select **Duplicate**.

    > [!TIP]
    > On [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] 2, you can reach out and select **Duplicate** directly with your finger. For more information about how to manipulate holograms in HoloLens 2, see [Authoring and navigating gestures for HoloLens 2](authoring-gestures-HL2.md).
