# Add a website or Power Apps link to a step in Dynamics 365 Guides

You can use add a website link or a [!include[pn-powerapps](../includes/pn-powerapps.md)] link to a Step card in [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)].

- **Website link.** Add a website link to a step so that operators can see and interact with information outside [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]. For example, you might want to provide a link to a parts diagram, a parts inventory system, an analytics dashboard, or information about Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Website links let authors create a seamless workflow for operators.

1. On the right side of the page, select the **Action** tab.
