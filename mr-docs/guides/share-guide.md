## Share a guide with someone else

Teams should be structured so that ownership of a guide is assigned to one or more teams that include the groups of users who need to collaborate on guides as authors, or use the guides as operators. In exceptional cases, you can use the **Share** option for individuals who are not members of a team. For details on the sharing process, see [Use access teams to limit access to specific guides or guide content in Dynamics 365 Guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/admin-access-teams).

> [!NOTE]
> When you share a guide, the content (images, videos, and 3D objects) associated with the guide is not automatically shared. You can use the **All Content** tab in the Guides model-driven app to do bulk operations, such as sharing content.
