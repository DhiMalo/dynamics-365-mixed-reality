This article describes the permissions that are required to use the HoloLens app in version 7.0 of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides.

## Why eye-tracking permissions are required 

Eye tracking is required to use the main menu and to create a great experience. Eye tracksing lets HoloLens know what you’re looking at and helps validate 
your intentions. Eye tracking has been designed with user privacy in mind. Microsoft doesn’t store any biometric or other identifiable information. 
For these reasons, eye-tracking capable applications require you to grant app permission to use eye tracking information.
