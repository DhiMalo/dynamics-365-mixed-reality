# HoloLens permissions required to use version 7.0 of Dynamics 365 Guides

Version 7.0 of Dynamics 365 Guides introduced a new main menu and the ability to make calls from HoloLens. To use these new features, you must provide permission to use HoloLens eye tracking, and the HoloLens camera and microphone. 

When you open the HoloLens app for the first time using Dynamics 365 Guides version 7, you're prompted to provide permission to use eye tracking and the camera and microphone. If you choose not to provide permission at that time, you can do it later as described in this article.

## Why eye-tracking permission is required 

Eye tracking is required to use the main menu and to create a great experience. Eye tracking lets HoloLens know what you’re looking at and helps validate 
your intentions. 

Eye tracking has been designed with user privacy in mind. Microsoft doesn’t store any biometric or other identifiable information.
