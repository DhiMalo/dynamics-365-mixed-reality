# Migrate Dynamics 365 Guides content from one Microsoft Dataverse instance to another using the Content Migration Tool (Public Preview)

The Content Migration Tool (Public Preview) for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides is a [Windows PowerShell](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/powershell) script that copies content from one instance of Microsoft Dataverse to another. You can migrate all the content in an instance or just specific types of content (for example, 3D objects, images, and videos). After the migration is completed, the content exists in both instances. The content in the source instance isn't changed in any way.

The tool connects to two Microsoft Dataverse instances at the same time. It reads the content in the source instance and writes it to the destination instance. The instances can be part of the same tenant, or they can be in different tenants.

The tool supports migration between commercial and/or Microsoft Government Community Cloud (GCC) environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By using the Content Migration Tool (Public Preview) for Dynamics 365 Guides, you acknowledge and accept all the limitations of using a preview tool. For example, you accept that the terms and commitments for Dynamics 365 Guides and other Microsoft commercial services and products don't apply to the Content Migration Tool. You also assume all risks that are associated with migrating your data between Dynamics 365 tenants. These risks include but aren't limited to the risk of different security, compliance, and privacy commitments, the risk of damage to or loss of data, and the risk of unavailability or interruption of the tool.

The tool supports the following types of migration.

| Type of migration | What is migrated? |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| All content | Everything that is stored in the instance that is active. (Telemetry events that are associated with a guide are excluded.) |
| Guides and associated content | Active guides, and any 3D objects, images, or videos that are related to those guides. Inactive content that is associated with a guide is also migrated. You can migrate all existing guides at one time, or you can select specific guides to migrate. |
| All 3D objects, images, and videos | All active 3D objects, images, and videos that are stored in the instance. |
| Only 3D objects | Active 3D objects only. You can migrate all existing 3D objects at one time, you can migrate all 3D objects that belong to a 3D object collection, or you can select specific 3D objects to migrate. |
| Only images | Active images only. You can migrate all existing images at one time, or you can select specific images to migrate. |
| Only videos | Active videos only. You can migrate all existing videos at one time, or you can select specific videos to migrate. |

> [!NOTE]
> - If you have created a folder structure in your instance, [you can migrate it using the Power Platform's export/import functionality](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/admin-export-import-folders). Moving the folders first, and then the content will ensure that the folder and content hierarchy is retained. 
> - [Website and Power Apps links](pc-app-website-powerapps-link.md) are migrated when you migrate guides. However, for Power Apps, you must manually import the apps into the new instance and update the links in the appropriate steps.
> - The Content Migration Tool doesn't support migration of guides that are based on schema v3 or v4. If you've updated your Dynamics 365 Guides solution to the latest version, but you still have a guide that is based on schema v3 or v4, you can [do a manual upgrade](./upgrade.md).
> - For 3D objects that belong to a 3D object collection, the parent 3D object won't be migrated unless you have the **System Admin** role.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a Dynamics Insider Program account to access the download files.

- You must be a system admin for the computer that you use to run the Windows PowerShell script.

- You must use [Windows PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7#how-to-check-the-version-of-powershell) version 5.1.18362.752 or later.

- Both the source instance and the destination instance must use Dynamics 365 Guides solution version 700.0.0.x or later. 

- You must have credentials to sign in to the source instance in the **System Admin** role (preferable) or **Operator/Author** role (required).

- You must have credentials to sign in to the destination instance in the **System Admin** role (preferable) or **Author** role (required).

We also highly recommend that you [back up the contents](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments#create-a-manual-backup) of both instances before you start the migration process.

> [!NOTE]
> The Content Migration Tool doesn't support multi-factor authentication.
