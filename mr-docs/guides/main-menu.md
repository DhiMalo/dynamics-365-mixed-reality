# Use the Main menu in Dynamics 365 Guides to open a guide or start a call

Version 7.0 of Dynamics 365 Guides introduces a new Main menu for the HoloLens app that makes it very quick and easy to open a guide or start a call with a remote collaborator. After signing in to the app, just look at the palm of your hand to open the Main menu and choose an activity using direct touch.

## Summon the Main menu whenever you need it

When working with a complex machine in a busy environment, you need the right holographic information at your fingertips at the right time to help you with your work, but after getting the answer you need, you also need to be able to minimize holographic information quickly so that you can continue with your work. The Main menu makes it very quick and easy to access the information you need but also avoids holographic clutter because it doesn't follow you around in your environment like an instruction card. Whenever you need to switch activities, just look at the palm of your hand to bring the Main menu to you (you don't have to remember where you put it in your environment). 

When the Main menu is open, you can also move it wherever you want by grabbing it with your hand(s). You can also pivot it, if needed.
