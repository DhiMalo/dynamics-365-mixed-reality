Version 7.0 of Dynamics 365 Guides introduced a new Main menu for the HoloLens app. After you sign in to the app, you're prompted to look at the palm of your hand, which opens the Main menu. You can use this menu to choose an activity by using touch (with one or two hands).

The following table describes the activities available through the buttons on the Main menu.

|Choose this button|To|
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
||Do a work item. Work items include:<br><br>- Select and open a guide.<br>- Search for a guide.<br>- Choose a role (Author or Operator).|
||Make a call. Call choices include:<br><br>- Select a contact from the **Recents** list.<br>- Search for a contact.<br>- Start a call and work with the Call window.|
||Change a setting.|
|| Sign out.|

> [!TIP]
> You can work with a guide as an author or operator and make a call at the same time. This is useful if you need to consult with a remote expert on a procedure. The remote expert can see everything that you see on your HoloLens and provide instructions as needed. You can also make a call 

## The Main menu is at your beck and call

The Main menu doesn't follow you around in your environment like an instruction card, but it's very quick and easy to open it whenever you need it by looking at the palm of your hand. So, for example, if you have a guide open and you're on a call consulting with a remote expert, you don't have to remember where you last accessed the call window in your environment. Just look at the palm of your hand again to bring it to you.

When the Main menu is open, you can also move it wherever you want by grabbing it with your hand(s). You can also pivot it, if needed.
