# Use the Main menu in Dynamics 365 Guides to open a guide or start a call

Version 7.0 of Dynamics 365 Guides introduces a new Main menu for the HoloLens app that makes it very quick and easy to open a guide or start a call with a remote collaborator by using direct touch. After signing in to the app, just look at the palm of your hand to open the Main menu and choose an activity.

## Make a call and work with a guide at the same time

You can work with a guide as an author or operator and make a call at the same time. For example, if you're authoring a guide, you might want to call an expert to get advice on a specific procedure. If you're an operator, you might want to call an expert to get help on a procedure or to do a remote inspection. The remote expert can see everything that you see on your HoloLens and provide input as needed. 

You can start a call after you open a guide, open a guide after placing a call, or do both simiultaneously. You can also make a call or work on a guide independently.
