Version 7.0 of Dynamics 365 Guides introduced a new Main menu for the HoloLens app. After you sign in to the app, you're prompted to look at the palm of your hand, which opens the Main menu. You can use this menu to choose an activity by using touch (with one or two hands).

The following table describes the activities available through the buttons on the Main menu.

## The Main menu is at your beck and call

The Main menu doesn't follow you around in your environment like an instruction card, but it's very quick and easy to open it whenever you need it by looking at the palm of your hand. So, for example, if you have a guide open and you're on a call consulting with a remote expert, you don't have to remember where you last accessed the call window in your environment. Just look at the palm of your hand again to bring it to you.

When the Main menu is open, you can also move it wherever you want by grabbing it with your hand(s). You can also pivot it, if needed. 

## When to use touch vs. gaze in Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0

|Area|Touch or gaze?|

|Call window|Touch|
|Instruction cards|**Authors** can use a combination of gaze, hand rays, touch, or voice commands, depending on the task.<br><br>**Operators** can use gaze, air tap, and voice commands.

## Make a call and work with a guide at the same time

You can work with a guide as an author or operator and make a call at the same time. For example, if you're authoring a guide, you might want to call an expert to get advice on a specific procedure. If you're an operator, you might want to call an expert to get help on a procedure or to do a remote inspection. The remote expert can see everything that you see on your HoloLens and provide input as needed. 

You can start a call after you open a guide, open a guide after placing a call, or do both simiultaneously. You can also make a call or work on a guide independently.
