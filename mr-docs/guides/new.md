# What's new in Dynamics 365 Guides

This page provides details about the **current wave of features (October 2021 through March 2022)** for [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)], organized by release date. To see a comprehensive list of released and upcoming features, see <a href="/dynamics365/release-plans/" target="_blank">Dynamics 365 and Power Platform release plans</a>. You can also <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/version-history" target="_blank">see a complete list of features organized by previous waves</a>. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Guides Dataverse solution version 700.1.0.1, which is now available, is a foundational change for key features in upcoming Dynamics 365 Guides releases and includes the new MR App Session table. Updated versions of the PC and HoloLens apps are available for the new solution and **require the 700.0.0.1 or newer solution.** To install solution version 700.1.0.1, it's a good idea to first install solution version 700.0.0.1 if you havenâ€™t already. Also, if you have created any custom security roles, **make sure to update those custom roles to match the permissions for relevant Dynamics 365 Guides Security roles (Author, Operator, Restricted Author, Restricted Operator) so that any custom roles have access to the new MR App Session table.**
> 
> If you choose not to update the solution and remain on the version 600 solution and compatible versions of the PC and HoloLens apps, there's no impact.
>
> Work with your IT admin to schedule installation updates or <a href="/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade" target="_blank">see instructions for updating the solution</a>. You can also [learn more about which solutions work with which applications](admin-apps-solution-compatibility.md). See the **Features** table below to determine if a new feature requires a solution update.
