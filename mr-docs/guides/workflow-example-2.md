# Workflow example 2: Create a Dynamics 365 Guides 3D object collection and add objects to the collection

In this workflow example, we’ll use Microsoft Power Automate to create a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides 3D object collection. 3D object collections appear as categories (**Arrows**, **Generic Tools**, and so on) in the Dynamics 365 Guides 3D toolkit. You can use Power Automate to create a new category for your 3D objects, and then add objects to the collection through the Dynamics 365 Guides model-driven app.

 > [!NOTE]
> You must have the Environment Maker role (Power Platform) to create a Microsoft Power Automate flow.
 
## What you'll learn in this example

- How to get the Parent ID for a 3D object collection

- How to use the Parent ID when adding a new record in Power Automate

- How to use the Guides model-driven app to add an object

**Estimated time to create the 3D object collection:** 10 minutes

## Create a 3D object collection in Power Automate

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://us.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) with the same account that you want to create the 3D object collection in.

2. Select **Create**, and then select **Instant cloud flow** to create a new flow.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also set this flow up to trigger automatically, for example, when a record is updated. 
    
3. Give your flow a name, select **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **Create**.

4. Select **New step**, and then select the **Add a new row** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can filter the list of Microsoft Dataverse actions by selecting the **Microsoft Dataverse** button.
    
5. In the **Add a new row** trigger, in the **Table name** field, select **3D Object Collections**, enter a name for your new collection in the **Name** field, and then select **Show advanced options** to see all the fields related to adding a new row.

    ![Add a new row trigger showing Table name field and Name field.](media/workflow2-add-new-row-trigger.PNG "Add a new row trigger showing Table name field and Name field")
 
6. To get the value for the **Parent ID** field for the new collection, go to the Guides model-driven app, select **3D Toolkit**, and then select one of the existing object collections. For example, select the **Arrows** collection.

    ![Model-driven app screen with Arrows collection selected.](media/workflow2-arrows-collection.PNG "Model-driven app screen with Arrows collection selected")
 
7. Copy the value in the **Parent ID** field. 

    ![Model-driven app screen with Parent ID selected.](media/workflow2-parent-ID.PNG "Model-driven app screen with Parent ID selected")
 
8. In the **Add a new row** trigger in Power Automate, paste the copied text into the **Parent ID** field.

    ![Power Automate screen with Parent ID pasted in the Parent ID field.](media/workflow2-add-new-row-parent-ID.PNG "Power Automate screen with Parent ID pasted in the Parent ID field")
 
9. Fill out other fields in the **Add a new row** screen as follows:

    |Field| Selection|
    |-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    |**Record Created On** |**Timestamp.** You can select this value from the dynamic list after placing your cursor in the field. This sets the **Created On** field in the model-driven app.|
    |**Status Reason**| **Active.** Dataverse tables should be set to active unless otherwise noted.|

    The completed Add a new row screen looks like this:
    
    ![Add a new row triger filled in.](media/workflow2-add-new-row-trigger-filled-out.PNG "Add a new row trigger filled in")
 
10. Select **Save** in the upper-right corner of the screen.

11. To test the flow, in the upper-right corner of the screen, select **Test**, select **Manually**, and then select **Test**. 

    ![Test flow pane in Power Automate.](media/workflow2-test.PNG "Test flow pane in Power Automate")
 
12. In the **Run flow** pane, select **Run flow**. 

    If your flow is successful, you’ll see the new category in the **Active 3D Object Collections** screen in the model-driven app.

## Add an object to the new 3D object collection

You can add new objects to the collection directly in the model driven-app.

1. Open the Guides model driven-app.

2. Select **Collections**, and then select the new collection.
	
2. In the lower-right corner of the screen, select **Add Existing 3D Object**.

    ![Model-driven-app screen with Add Existing 3D Object selected.](media/workflow2-add-object.PNG "Model-driven-app screen with Add Existing 3D Object selected")
 
3. Use the search box to find the 3D object you want to add to the collection or select it from the **Recent records** list, and then select **Add**. 

    ![Lookup Records pane in model-driven app.](media/workflow2-lookup-object.PNG "Lookup Records pane in model-driven app")
 
    Now when you open the 3d toolkit in the PC app, you’ll see your new 3D object collection and the newly associated object.

## Idea for further customization

You could create a Power Automate flow that automatically adds any new 3D objects uploaded by users on your team to a 3D object collection.
