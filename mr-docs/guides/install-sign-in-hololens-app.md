# Install and sign in to the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

If you haven't already installed the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device (or if it hasn't already been installed for you), you can install it from the [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store for Consumers.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a license to install the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app. You can also sign up for a free trial. For more information, see [Setup overview](setup.md).

## Install the app

1. Make sure that you have [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] build 10.0.14393.0 or later installed on your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device. We recommend that you update to newer versions when they are available. For information about how to use [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] Update for Business, see [Manage updates to HoloLens](/HoloLens/hololens-updates).

2. On your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)], use the [bloom gesture](authoring-gestures.md) to open the **Home** menu. Then open [!include[cc-microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Store, and search for "[!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)]".

3. Select **Install** to download and install the [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] app.

## Sign in

If you sign in to a brand-new [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] device, you'll be prompted to complete the **Setup** wizard. In the **Setup** wizard, you can either sign in by using an existing account or create a new account, depending on the version of [!include[pn-ms-windows-short](../includes/pn-ms-windows-short.md)] that you're running. The **Setup** wizard will also guide you through steps to calibrate and prepare your [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] for use.

## Open and sign in for the first time

After you've made sure that your [HoloLens is correctly calibrated](hololens-app-calibrate.md), you can open the [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app.

If you're a [!include[pn-dyn-365-guides](../includes/pn-dyn-365-guides.md)] admin, you can assign **Author** and **Operator** roles to limit the features that are available to users. For more information, see [Assign an Author or Operator role to a user](assign-role.md).
