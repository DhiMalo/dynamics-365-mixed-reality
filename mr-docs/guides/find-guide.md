# Find and open a guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app 

How you find and open a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides depends on which version you're using. If you're using version 7.0 or later, you use the [Main menu](main-menu.md) and direct touch to find and open a guide. If you're using an earlier version of Dynamics 365 Guides, you use gaze to find and open a guide.

## Find and open a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides version 7.0 

1. Look at the palm of your hand to open the Main menu, and then select the **Work activity** button.

2. Select the **Recent** or **All** tab, and then select the appropriate file or folder.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Folders appear on the **All** tab, but not the **Recent** tab. 

3. To search for a guide:

    1. Select the magnifying glass to display the holographic keyboard.

    2. Enter some characters for the guide you're looking for. As you start to enter the characters, the guide list automatically filters to the guide names that match those characters.

1. After signing in to the HoloLens app, you'll see the **Select guide** dialog box. In the **Select guide** dialog box, gaze at the **Recent** or **All** tab, and then gaze at the circle next to the file or folder you want to open. To scroll the list, gaze at the up or down arrow to the left of the list.
