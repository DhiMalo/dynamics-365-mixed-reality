# Find and open a guide in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app 

How you find and open a guide in Dynamics 365 Guides depends on which version you're using. If you're using version 7.0 or later, you use the [Main menu](main-menu.md) and direct touch to find and open a guide. If you're using an earlier version of Dynamics 365 Guides, you use gaze to find and open a guide.

## Find and open a guide in version 7.0 

1. Look at the palm of your hand to open the Main menu, and then select the **Work** button.

2. Select the **Recent** or **All** tab, and then select the appropriate file or folder. Folders appear on the **All** tab, but not the **Recent** tab.

3. To search for guide:

    1. Select the magnifying glass to display the holographic keyboard.

    2. Enter some characters for the guide you're looking for. As you start to enter the characters, the guide list automatically filters to the guide names that match those characters.
